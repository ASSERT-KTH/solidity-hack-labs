# HACK-LABS

[![Test Suite](https://github.com/ASSERT-KTH/solidity-hack-labs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ASSERT-KTH/solidity-hack-labs/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A comprehensive framework for testing smart contract security patches against real-world exploits. This project provides:
1. A reproducible dataset of smart contract exploits for SmartBugs-Curated dataset
2. An automated tool for evaluating security patches

## 📊 Exploit Dataset Coverage

Our dataset is based on the [DASP taxonomy](https://dasp.co/) and covers the following vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability            | Total Contracts | Working Exploits | Coverage % |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Reentrancy               | 31              | 26              | 83.9%      |
| Access Control           | 18              | 16              | 88.9%      |
| Arithmetic               | 15              | 13              | 86.7%      |
| Unchecked Low Level Calls| 52              | 20              | 38.5%      |
| Denial Of Service        | 6               | 4               | 66.7%      |
| Bad Randomness           | 8               | 4               | 50.0%      |
| Front Running            | 4               | 3               | 75.0%      |
| Time Manipulation        | 5               | 3               | 60.0%      |
| Short Addresses          | 1               | 0               | 0.0%       |
| Others                   | 3               | 2               | 66.7%      |
| **Total**                | **143**         | **91**          | **63.6%**  |

### Coverage Limitations and Technical Constraints

The following table summarizes why certain contracts in our dataset could not be exploited:

| Challenge Type              | Number of Contracts |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Not Exploitable            | 30                |
| Missing Methods            | 9                 |
| Mislabeled Solidity Version| 7                 |
| Exceeded Time Limit        | 3                 |
| Incompatible Solidity Version| 1               |
| Honeypot Contracts         | 1                 |
| Hash Cracking Required     | 1                 |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Testing Exploits
Navigate to the exploit dataset:
```bash
cd smartbugs-curated/0.4.x
npm ci
npx hardhat test
```

### Evaluating Patches
Navigate to the evaluator tool:
```bash
cd evaluator
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Test a patch:
```bash
python src/main.py \
    --format solidity \
    --patch ./your-patch.sol \
    --contract-file ./target-contract.sol \
    --main-contract ContractName
```
